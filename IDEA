Code Review Agent for PRs with Latency & Risk Detection

Pain Point: Teams struggle to review PRs for performance bottlenecks or security issues

üèóÔ∏èTo build: An AI agent that reviews PRs and flags latency, security, or logic issues ‚Äî like a smart co-reviewer.

üîç Existing Code Review LLM Projects:
1. Code-Reviewer-GPT (https://github.com/Diqsy/Code-Reviewer-GPT)
	‚Ä¢	Uses GPT to review code and PRs
	‚Ä¢	Focus: general suggestions, style, logic
	‚Ä¢	No latency/simulation or API-specific warnings

2. IBM Automated Code Review LLM (https://github.com/IBM/automated-code-review-llm)
	‚Ä¢	Uses Watsonx to do automated reviews
	‚Ä¢	Mostly basic logic + comment generation
	‚Ä¢	Not latency-aware or performance focused

3. Sourcegraph Cody (https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody)
	‚Ä¢	Full AI dev tool, not open-source
	‚Ä¢	Pair programming + suggestions
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise-level ‚Äî not DIY-friendly

4. Amazon CodeWhisperer
	‚Ä¢	Proprietary, security suggestions only
	‚Ä¢	No public repo for forking or extending

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Missing in Existing Projects ‚Äî Your Differentiator
	1.	Latency-aware PR review ‚Äî no one simulates or analyzes performance
	2.	Code risk estimation ‚Äî LLM commenting on potential bottlenecks
	3.	Lightweight + portable (FastAPI, Hugging Face) ‚Äî DIY-friendly version
	4.	Explains fix suggestions (XAI-ish) ‚Äî most just dump bullet suggestions
	5.	Log + track latency per PR ‚Äî analytics component = gold for dev leads
